LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from text documents during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process. LLMs are artificial neural networks following a transformer architecture.</p></aside><p id="-9rpe5q_80">in other words:</p><p id="-9rpe5q_81"><span class="control" id="-9rpe5q_82">LLMs are trained on vast datasets of texts like books, websites or user generated contents. They can generate new text that continues an initial prompt in a natural way.</span></p><p id="-9rpe5q_83">LLM model is basically a neural network with a lot of parameters. Roughly speaking, the more parameters, the better the model is. So we always hear about the size of the model, which is the number of parameters. For example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, and GPT-4 may have over 1 trillion parameters.</p><p id="-9rpe5q_84"><span class="control" id="-9rpe5q_85">But what exactly a model looks like?</span></p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="model-is-just-a-file" data-toc="model-is-just-a-file">Model is just a file</h2><p id="-9rpe5q_86">A language model is just a binary file:</p><figure id="-9rpe5q_87"><img alt="A language model is just a file" src="images/a-language-model-is-just-a-file.png" title="A language model is just a file" width="400" height="465"></figure><p id="-9rpe5q_88">(from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY" id="-9rpe5q_89" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrej Karpathy's build a GPT model from scratch)</a>)</p><p id="-9rpe5q_90">In above image, the <span class="emphasis" id="-9rpe5q_91"><span class="control" id="-9rpe5q_92">parameters</span></span> file is <span class="emphasis" id="-9rpe5q_93">Meta's Llama-2-70b <span class="control" id="-9rpe5q_94">model</span></span>, and its size is 140GB which contains 70b parameters (in a format of digits).

Each model is trained or fine-tuned on a specific domain and work together to bring the best perform during inference.</p><p id="-9rpe5q_101">But don't worry, our goal is to understand and learn about the fundamentals of large language models. Fortunately, we can still train a model (with much fewer parameters) on our personal computers.

Base on the chunk of data we provide, you can think of this way:</p><p id="-9rpe5q_112"><code class="code" id="-9rpe5q_113">I like to eat apple</code> is a very common sentence that the model <span class="emphasis" id="-9rpe5q_114">learned</span> for multiple times.</p><p id="-9rpe5q_115"><code class="code" id="-9rpe5q_116">I like to eat banana</code> is also a common sentence but less common than the one above.</p><p id="-9rpe5q_117">So during training, the model:</p><aside class="prompt" data-type="note" data-title="" id="-9rpe5q_118"><p id="-9rpe5q_119">recorded <code class="code" id="-9rpe5q_120">apple</code> with <span class="control" id="-9rpe5q_121">0.375</span> probability to appear after <code class="code" id="-9rpe5q_122">I like to eat</code></p><p id="-9rpe5q_123">recorded <code class="code" id="-9rpe5q_124">banana</code> with <span class="control" id="-9rpe5q_125">0.146</span> probability to appear after <code class="code" id="-9rpe5q_126">I like to eat</code></p><p id="-9rpe5q_127"><span class="emphasis" id="-9rpe5q_128">... other character probabilities ...</span></p></aside><p id="-9rpe5q_129">So these probabilities result in <span class="emphasis" id="-9rpe5q_130">probability sets</span> saved in the <span class="emphasis" id="-9rpe5q_131"><span class="control" id="-9rpe5q_132">parameters</span></span> model file.

However, the team at OpenAI discovered that the transformer architecture was the crucial solution for character prediction.
