LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from text documents during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process. LLMs are artificial neural networks following a transformer architecture.</p></aside><p id="y1hrc_6">in other words:</p><p id="y1hrc_7"><span class="control" id="y1hrc_8">LLMs are trained on vast datasets of texts like books, websites or user generated contents. They can generate new text that continues an initial prompt in a natural way.</span></p><p id="y1hrc_9">LLM model is basically a neural network with a lot of parameters. Roughly speaking, the more parameters, the better the model is. So we always hear about the size of the model, which is the number of parameters. For example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, and GPT-4 may have over 1 trillion parameters.</p><p id="y1hrc_10"><span class="control" id="y1hrc_11">But what exactly a model looks like?</span></p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="model-is-just-a-file" data-toc="model-is-just-a-file">Model is just a file</h2><p id="y1hrc_12">A language model is just a binary file:</p><figure id="y1hrc_13"><img alt="A language model is just a file" src="images/a-language-model-is-just-a-file.png" title="A language model is just a file" width="400" height="465"></figure><p id="y1hrc_14">(from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY" id="y1hrc_15" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrej Karpathy's build a GPT model from scratch)</a>)</p><p id="y1hrc_16">In above image, the <span class="emphasis" id="y1hrc_17"><span class="control" id="y1hrc_18">parameters</span></span> file is <span class="emphasis" id="y1hrc_19">Meta's Llama-2-70b <span class="control" id="y1hrc_20">model</span></span>, and its size is 140GB which contains 70b parameters (in a format of digits).

Fortunately, we can still train a model (with much fewer parameters) on our personal computers.

However, the team at OpenAI discovered that the transformer architecture was the crucial solution for character prediction.
